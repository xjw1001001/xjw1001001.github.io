## Reminders

- HW 1 is due tomorrow at 9pm

  - I posted an updated version with few clarifications:
  
    - Vectors: You can put anything youâ€™d like in the vector, i.e., any suitable input to the first argument of `sample()`.
    - Arrays: the last line of instructions is for the first matrix.
    - Matrices: the vector to multiply with is a length 3 vector. It may be 3 x 1 or 1 x 3 to be compatible with the dimensions of the matrix that you are multiplying with, and the matrix should be the original one, and not the one that is multiplied by 3.

  - If you've already started working with the Rmd file of the original version, there is no need to update to the new version.
  
- HW 2 will be posted on Friday afternoon on the course website

## Vocabulary of statistics

* A **subject**: A person, place or thing from which we collect data.

* A **population**: The collection of all subjects of interest.

* A **sample**: A subset of the population, from which we have collected data

> **Sample size**: number of subjects in a sample

* A **variable**: A characteristic of a subject

---

### Examples in datasets

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[murders]

For the `murders` dataset in `dslabs` package, we take a sample of 3 states:

```{r}
library(dslabs)
head(murders, 3)
```

* **subject** is one US state. 
* **population** is ALL US state. 
* **sample** is Alabama, Alaska, Arizona for this small sample presented here.
* **variable** include: region, population, total (murders)

]
.panel[.panel-name[heights help page]

For the `heights` dataset in `dslabs` package, we use help to get information of `heights` dataset

```{r eval = F}
?heights
```

* Self-Reported Heights

> Description: Self-reported heights in inches for males and females.

>Usage: data(heights)

>Format: An object of class "data.frame".

>Details:sex. Male or Female.

> height. Height in inches.

]

.panel[.panel-name[heights]

```{r}
head(heights, 3)
# Here we have 1050 observations
dim(heights)
```

So for this dataset:

* **subject** is one student (possibly in some school). 
* **population** is all students inside that school. 
* **sample** is the 1050 students inside the dataset.
* **variable** include: sex, height
]
.panel[.panel-name[Sample VS population]

* Sample is a subgroup of population!

* Ideally, a sample should be **representative** of the population.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/sample-size-definition.png")
```

## Terminology: Number of variables involved

- **Univariate** data analysis: distribution of single variable

- **Bivariate** data analysis: relationship between two variables

- **Multivariate** data analysis: relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

---

### Type of variables

In statistics, different types of variables are analyzed in different ways.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Concepts]

* The four main types are: 

* **Categorical** variables: (*Not a number*)

    - **Nominmal**: categorical variables with no inherent order. Examples: gender, ethnicity, and religion.
    
    > All genders, ethnicity, religions are equal!
    
    - **Ordinal**: categorical variables with a natural order or ranking. Examples: education level (e.g., high school, college, graduate school)
    
* **Numerical** variables: (*Numbers*)
    
    - **Continuous**: Numbers can take any value
    
    - **Discrete**: Numbers can only take on a *finite* or *countably infinite set* of possible values

]
.panel[.panel-name[murders]

In murders dataset:

```{r}
head(murders, 3)
```

* abb, region are categorical; nominal

* population and total are numeric; discrete

]

.panel[.panel-name[heights]

```{r}
head(heights)
```


* sex is categorical; nominal

* height is numeric; continuous

  - Though here it seems to only include integer values.

]
.panel[.panel-name[Small quiz]

What are the types of these variables?

- Number of people in each class

- Letter grades

- Shape of leaf

- Zip code: (95618 for Davis, 95776 for Woodland)

- Heights of newborn babies
]

.panel[.panel-name[solution]
- Number of people in each class **discrete**

- Letter grades **ordinal**

- Shape of leaf **nominal**

- Zip code: (95618 for Davis, 95776 for Woodland) **nominal**

- Heights of newborn babies **continuous**
