## Recap

--

- Conditional probability
  - General multiplication rule: `\(P(A \cap B) = P(B)P(A|B)\)`
  - Sum of conditional probabilities: `\(P(A_1|B) + ... + P(A_k| B) = 1\)`
  - Law of total probability: `\(P(B) = P(B \cap A_1)+ ... + P(B \cap {A_k}) = P(B \mid A_1)P(A_1) + ... + P(B \mid {A_k})P({A_k})\)`

- Marginal and joint probability 

- Revisiting independence
  - `\(P(A \mid B)=P(A)\)` and `\(P(B \mid A)=P(B)\)`

- Bayes' Theorem
  - `\(P(A \mid B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} =\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^c)P(A^c)}\)`

  - Discrete and continuous random variables

- Common probability distributions

---
## Random variables

- A random variable is a mapping or a function from possible outcomes in a sample space to a probability space. 

- Recall: **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes from a **random process**

- Let `\(X\)` be the random variable indicating whether a coin flip results in heads.

- Instead of saying `\(P(\texttt{heads})\)`, we say `\(P(X = 1)\)`

- This representation allows us to apply mathematical frameworks and get a better understanding of real-world phenomenon

---
## Random variables

- Random variables are usually denoted by capital letters, most commonly `\(X\)`, `\(Y\)`, `\(Z\)`

- A **realization** or draw of the random variable is denoted by a lowercase letter, `\(x\)`, `\(y\)`, `\(z\)`

- Other examples of random variables:

  - Mass of classroom chairs
  
  - Ages of students at UC Davis

- For discrete random variables:
  
  - Each outcome has an associated probability `\(P(X = x_i)\)` where `\(i = 1, ..., k\)` ( `\(k\)` outcomes are denoted by lower-case, `\(x_1, ..., x_k\)`)
  - Sometimes also written as `\(p_1, ..., p_k\)` 

---

Another example:

Let’s assume, we have a sample space containing 4 students `{A, B, C, D}`. If we now randomly pick student `A` and measure the height in centimeters, we can think of the random variable (`H`) as the function with the input of student and the output of height as a real number.

&lt;img src="img/11.webp" width="60%" /&gt;

Depending on the outcome — which student is randomly picked — our random variable (`H`) can take on different states or different values in terms of height in centimeters.

---

## Probability Distribution 

The description of how likely a random variable takes one of its possible states can be given by a probability distribution. 

Thus, the probability distribution is a mathematical function that gives the probabilities of different outcomes for a random variable.

* More generally it can be described as the function

`$$P: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$`

Which maps an input space `\(A\)` — related to the sample space — to a real number, namely the probability.

For the above function to characterize a probability distribution, it must follow all of the axioms:

1. All probabilities must between 0 and 1. `\(0\leq p(x) \leq 1\)`
2. All probabilities must summed up to be 1. `\(\sum p(x) = 1\)`

---

## Discrete RV distribution

Discrete RV: it can only take on a finite number of values within an interval, and the value has the natural gaps

The **probability mass function (PMF)** describes the probability distribution over a **discrete** random variable. 

&gt; In other terms, it is a function that returns the probability of a random variable being exactly equal to a specific value. `\(P(X=i)=P(i)\)`

The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** describes the probability that a random variable is less than or equal than a given value.

&gt; `\(F(x) = P(X \leq x) = \sum_{X \leq x}P(X=x)\)`

---

## probability mass function (PMF) for Discrete RV

- Example: Two books are assigned for a statistics class: a textbook and its corresponding study guide. The university bookstore determined 20% of enrolled students do not buy either book, 55% buy the textbook only, and 25% buy both books, and these percentages are relatively constant from one quarter to another.

- Formally: Let `\(X=\)` number of books sold per student 

- The three possible outcomes are `\(x_1\)` = 0 books, `\(x_2\)` = 1 book (1 textbook for each student), `\(x_3\)` = 2 books (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
`\(x_i\)` | 0 | 1 | 2
`\(P(X = x_i)\)` | .2 | .55 | .25

--|--|--|--
`\(x_i\)` | 0 | 1 | 2
`\(P(X = x_i)\)` | .2 | .55 | .25
`\(F(X \leq x_i)\)` | .2 | .75 | 1

## Expectation 
Two books are assigned for a statistics class: a textbook and its corresponding study guide. The university bookstore determined 20% of enrolled students do not buy either book, 55% buy the textbook only, and 25% buy both books, and these percentages are relatively constant from one quarter to another. 

- How many books should the bookstore expect to sell per student?

- Intuitively: `\(.2*0 + .55*1 + .25*2 = 1.05\)` 

- Another way to think about it: say the class has 100 students. How many books should the bookstore expect to sell to the class? 

---
## Expectation 

- Formally: Let `\(X=\)` number of books sold per student 

- The three possible outcomes are `\(x_1\)` = 0 books, `\(x_2\)` = 1 book (1 textbook for each student), `\(x_3\)` = 2 books (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
`\(x_i\)` | 0 | 1 | 2
`\(P(X = x_i)\)` | .2 | .55 | .25

$$
`\begin{aligned}
E(X) &amp;= x_1 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$

- Using this definition: `\(E(X) = 0*.2 + 1* .55 + 2 * .25 = 1.05\)`.


---
## Expectation 

- Say we are interested in the amount of revenue that the bookstore can expect to earn per student. Say the textbook costs $ 137 and the study guide costs $ 33.

- What modifications do we need? 

  - Formally: Let `\(X=\)` number of books sold per student

  - The three possible outcomes are `\(x_1\)` = 0 books, `\(x_2\)` = 1 books (1 textbook for each student), `\(x_3\)` = 2 books (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
`\(x_i\)` | 0 | 1 | 2
`\(P(X = x_i)\)` | .2 | .55 | .25

  - Using this definition: `\(E(X) = 0*.2 + 1* .55 + 2 * .25 = 1.05\)`.
  
---
## Expectation 

- Say we are interested in the amount of revenue that the bookstore can expect to earn per student. Say the textbook costs $ 137 and the study guide costs $ 33.

- What modifications do we need? 

  - Formally: Let `\(X=\)` revenue from books sold per student

  - The three possible outcomes are `\(x_1\)` = $ 0, `\(x_2\)` = $ 137 (1 textbook for each student), `\(x_3\)` = $ 170 (1 textbook and 1 study guide for each student)

i | 1 | 2 | 3
--|--|--|--
`\(x_i\)` | 0 | 137 | 170
`\(P(X = x_i)\)` | .2 | .55 | .25


  - Using this definition: `\(E(X) = 0*.2 + 137* .55 + 170 * .25 = 117.85\)`.
 
---
## Expectation 

- The expectation is denoted by `\(E(X)\)`, `\(\mu\)` or `\(\mu_x\)`

- This is the expected or average outcome of `\(X\)`, where `\(X\)` is a random variable 

- Given a probability distribution for a discrete random variable, we can calculate it using

$$
`\begin{aligned}
E(X) &amp;= x_1 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$

- Recall: this is a **population parameter**, a fixed quantity
  - The sample version, the **sample statistic**, is the sample mean `\(\bar{x}\)`

---
## Properties of the expectation 

- `\(E[c] = c\)`, where c is a constant

- `\(E[aX] = aE[X]\)`

- `\(E[aX + c] = aE[X] + c\)`

- To calculate `\(E(X^2)\)` (will be useful later), simply replace `\(x_i\)` in the sum by `\(x_i^2\)`, i.e., 

$$
`\begin{aligned}
E(X^2) &amp;= x_1^2 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2^2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k^2 \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$

- More generally, `\(E[g(X)] = \sum_{i=1}^k g(x_i) P(X = x_i)\)` (Law of the unconscious statistician)

---
## Variance

- Recall: we saw the **sample variance**, calculated for a data set

  - Take the square of deviations and find the mean
  
  - `\(s^2 = \frac{(x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \bar{x})^2 + ... + (x_n - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}\)`

- **Population variance** is often denoted by `\(\sigma^2\)`, `\(\sigma_x^2\)`, or `\(Var(X)\)`

- Given a probability distribution for a discrete random variable, we can calculate it using

.small[
$$
`\begin{aligned}
Var(X) &amp;= E[(X-\mu)^2] \\
&amp;= (x_1 - \mu)^2 \times P(X = x_1) + (x_2 - \mu)^2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + (x_k - \mu)^2 \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k (x_i - \mu)^2 P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$
]

- Note: rather than summing over observations, these are over possible outcomes, weighted by their probabilities

---
## Variance

Another common way to write the variance is 
$$
`\begin{aligned}
Var(X) &amp;= E[(X-E(X))^2] \\
&amp;= E[ (X^2 - 2XE(X) + [E(X)]^2) ] \\
&amp;= E(X^2) - 2E(X)E(X) + [E(X)]^2 \\
&amp;= E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2
\end{aligned}`
$$

- Recall: `\(E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^k x_i P(X = x_i)\)`

- To calculate `\(E(X^2)\)`, simply replace `\(x_i\)` in the sum above by `\(x_i^2\)`, i.e., 

$$
`\begin{aligned}
E(X^2) &amp;= x_1^2 \times P(X = x_1) + x_2^2 \times P(X = x_2) + ... + x_k^2 \times P(X = x_k)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 P(X = x_i)
\end{aligned}`
$$

---
## Properties of the variance 

- `\(Var[c] = 0\)`, where c is a constant

- `\(Var[aX] = a^2Var[X]\)`

- `\(Var[aX + c] = a^2Var[X]\)`

---
## Linear combinations of random variables

- Often we care not just about a single random variable, but a combination of them

- E.g., 

  - The total revenue of our bookstore is a combination of books from different classes, not just our one statistics class
  
  - The total gain or loss in a stock portfolio is the sum of the gains and losses in its components
  
  - Total weekly commute time is a combination of daily commute
  
  
- Let `\(W\)` be the weekly commute time per student at UC Davis

  - `\(X_1\)` = commute time per student on Monday
  - `\(X_2\)` = commute time per student on Tuesday
  - ...
  - `\(X_5\)` =  commute time per student on Friday
  - `\(W = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_5\)` is also a random variable
  

---
## Linear combinations of random variables
- A **linear combination** of two random variables, `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`, is of the form 
$$
aX + bY,
$$

where `\(a\)` and `\(b\)` are constants.

- `\(a\)` and `\(b\)` are also called coefficients

- In our example, `\(W = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_5\)` is a linear combination with coefficients 1. 

---
## Expectation of linear combinations of random variables

- The expectation for a linear combination of random variables is given by 
$$
E(aX + bY) = aE(X) + bE(Y)
$$

- In our example, say `\(E(X_1) = ... = E(X_5) = 21\)` minutes.

- Then, `\(E(W) = 1*21 + 1*21 + 1*21 + 1*21 + 1*21 = 105\)` minutes.  

---
## Variance of linear combinations of random variables

- The variance for a linear combination of **independent** random variables
$$
Var(aX + bY) = a^2 Var(X) + b^2 Var(Y)
$$

- Note: this is only true if `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are independent. 

- In our example, say `\(Var(X_1) = ... = Var(X_5) = 5\)` minutes. 

- Commute times on each day of the week are independent. 

- Then, `\(Var(W) = 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 + 1^2*5 = 25\)` minutes.  


---
## Bernoulli random variable

- Note on terminology: when we say we have a Bernoulli random variable, we mean that the random variable follows a Bernoulli distribution

- Same with normal (or Gaussian) random variable, ... 

- Consider a binary random variable `\(Y\)`. By definition, `\(Y\)` must assume one of two possible values, e.g.

  - failure or success
  - dead or alive
  - UC Davis student or not
  - current smoker or not
  - heads or tails (coin flip)
  - Y chromosome or not 

- A random variable of this type is known as a **Bernoulli** random variable, and we describe the probability of response using the parameter `\(\pi\)` or `\(p\)`. 

---
## Bernoulli random variable

- `\(Y=1\)` is often called a "success," `\(Y=0\)` is called a "failure", and `\(\pi\)` or `\(p\)` is defined as the probability of a success, i.e., `\(P(Y = 1)\)`.

- The probability of a "failure," `\(P(Y = 0)\)` is then `\(1 - p\)`

- Examples:

  - Coin flip: let `\(Y=1\)` if heads and `\(Y=0\)` if tails, then `\(P(Y=1) = p=0.5\)`

  - Vegetarian in US: `\(Y=1\)` if vegetarian and `\(Y=0\)` if not, then `\(P(Y=1) = p=0.05\)` and `\(P(Y=0)=1-p=1-0.05=0.95\)`

  - Vegetarian in India: `\(Y=1\)` if vegetarian and `\(Y=0\)` if not, then `\(P(Y=1)=p=0.31\)` and `\(P(Y=0)=1-p=1-0.31=0.69\)`

---
## Bernoulli random variable
- Probability mass function for a Bernoulli distributed random variable is `\(P(Y=y)=p^y(1-p)^{1-y}\)`

  - `\(P(Y=1)=p^1(1-p)^0=p\)` (remember `\(x^0=1\)` for any `\(x\)`)
  
  - `\(P(Y=0)=p^0(1-p)^1=1-p\)`
  
- For the Bernoulli random variable, we don't really need this formality

- However, we want to extend this to more complex settings

- `\(E(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^k y_i P(Y = y_i) = p\)` and `\(Var(Y) = p(1-p)\)`


---
## From Bernoulli to binomial... 

- `\(Y\)` takes value 1 with probability `\(p\)` and value 0 with probability `\(1-p\)`

- `\(P(Y=y)=p^y(1-p)^{1-y}\)`

  - `\(P(Y=1)=p^1(1-p)^0=p\)` (remember `\(x^0=1\)` for any `\(x\)`)
  
  - `\(P(Y=0)=p^0(1-p)^1=1-p\)`
  
- For the Bernoulli random variable, we don't really need this formality

- However, we want to extend this to more complex settings

- For example, in a randomly-selected group of 3 high school students, how surprising would it be to get 2 who have smoked e-cigarettes in the past month?

- Could consider three draws from a Bernoulli distribution 

---

## Case Study: E-Cigarettes

- The [CDC reports](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/youth_data/tobacco_use/index.htm) that 19.6% of high school students have smoked e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. We'll round this to 20% for simplicity.

- `\(P(Y=1)=P(Smoker)=p=0.2\)` and `\(P(Y=0)=0.8\)`

- Now suppose we randomly select two independent high school students and define a new random variable `\(X\)` representing the number of smokers. X can take the values 0, 1, or 2. 

- Let `\(Y_1\)` be the smoking status of the first student and `\(Y_2\)` be the smoking status of the second student, where `\(Y_j = 1\)` if student `\(j\)` smokes and 0 otherwise.

Next we'll talk about how to get the *probability distribution* of `\(X\)`.

## Case Study: E-Cigarettes

- Recall: If events A and B are independent, then `\(P(A \cap B)=P(A)\times P(B).\)`

- Let `\(A_1\)` be the event that `\(Y_1=1\)` and let `\(A_2\)` be the event that `\(Y_2=1\)`. 

- Since the students are independent, 

$$
`\begin{aligned}
P(Y_1=Y_2=1) &amp; = P(A_1 \cap A_2) \\
 &amp; = P(A_1) P(A_2) \\
 &amp; = p \times p  \\
 &amp;= 0.2(0.2)\\
 &amp;=0.04. 
\end{aligned}`
$$

Recall our table:

| `\(Y_1\)` | `\(Y_2\)` | `\(X\)` | `\(P(X)\)` |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | `\(0.8 \times 0.8 = 0.64\)` |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | `\(0.2 \times 0.8 = 0.16\)` |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | `\(0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16\)` |
| 1 | 1 | 2 | `\(0.2 \times 0.2 =0.04\)` |
]

|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `\(X\)` | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| `\(P(X=x)\)` | 0.64 | 0.32 | 0.04 |

So if we randomly sample two US high schoolers, the probability that both are recent e-cig smokers is 0.04 (4% chance), the probability only one recently smoked is 0.32 (this can happen two ways -- either only the first smoked or only the second smoked), and the probability neither smoked e-cigs recently is 0.64.

## Case Study: E-Cigarettes

## Case Study: E-Cigarettes

Because these are independent high school students, we can calculate the probabilities in the same manner as before.


| `\(Y_1\)` | `\(Y_2\)` | `\(Y_3\)` | `\(X\)` | `\(P(X)\)` |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.8(0.8)(0.8)=0.512 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0.2(0.8)(0.8)=0.128 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0.8(0.2)(0.8)=0.128 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0.8(0.8)(0.2)=0.128 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0.2(0.2)(0.8)=0.032 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0.2(0.8)(0.2)=0.032 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0.8(0.2)(0.2)=0.032 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 0.2(0.2)(0.2)=0.008 |

The probability that 2 of 3 are recent e-cig smokers is `\(0.032+0.032+0.032=0.096\)` or 9.6%

## Case Study: E-Cigarettes

- Extending to 4 and more students, we can see why computing the probablities by hand, as we've done, is intractable

- We can use the **binomial distribution** to describe this random variable 

---

## Binomial random variable

- The **binomial distribution** gives us the probability of `\(X\)` "successes" from a sequence of `\(n\)` independent Bernoulli trials (size `\(n\)`). This is often denoted binomial(n, p).

- In our example, each student would represent an independent Bernoulli trial (either an e-cig smoker, or not).

  - 1 draw from the binomial distribution is made of 3 independent draws from the Bernoulli distribution 

- This distribution involves three assumptions.

  - There is a fixed number `\(n\)` of Bernoulli trials, each of which results in one of two mutually-exclusive outcomes
  
  - The outcomes of the `\(n\)` trials are independent
  
  - The probability of success `\(p\)` is the same for each trial

---

## Binomial distribution

- The probability mass function for the binomial distribution is given by `\(P(X=x)=\begin{pmatrix} n \\ x \end{pmatrix}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\)` 

- Compare this with `\(P(Y=y)=p^y(1-p)^{1-y}\)` for the Bernoulli distribution.

- First, look at the second part, `\(p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\)`. This is just multiplying the right combination of `\(p\)` and `\(1-p\)` as in the previous tables.

  - There will be a total of `\(n\)` terms being multiplied, one probability for each draw of the distribution (each student in this case)

  - For example, if we want the probability of 3 e-cig smokers, `\(X=3\)`, the second part is `\(p^x(1-p)^{n-x}=0.2^3(0.8)^0=0.008\)`, just as in the table.

---

## Binomial distribution

`$$P(X=x)=\begin{pmatrix} n \\ x \end{pmatrix}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$`

- If we want the probability of 2 e-cig smokers and 1 non-smoker, i.e., `\(x=2\)`, the second part is `\(p^x(1-p)^{n-x}=0.2^2(0.8)^{3-2}=0.032\)`, which is what we see in any single row in which we have two smokers and one non-smoker.

  - This is the probability of any one specific combination of 2 smokers and 1 nonsmoker. Then we need to figure out how many combinations of 2 smokers and 1 nonsmoker we could get.

- The first part, `\(\begin{pmatrix}n \\x \end{pmatrix}\)`, accounts for all the possible ways in which we can have 2 smokers out of 3 people.
