???
Here is the terminal or command-line, which is where you will be typing in commands and interacting with R programming.

The console is a powerful tool that allows you to enter commands and obtain answers from R. You can perform a wide range of operations in the console, such as data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

One of the strengths of R programming is that it is easily extensible with packages. These packages contain additional functions and tools that you can use to extend the capabilities of R. You can easily install and load packages in the console, which makes it a flexible and powerful tool for data science.

It's worth noting that while R programming can be used with menus and other graphical interfaces, these are often extras built on top of the console. The console is the primary interface for working with R, and it's important to become comfortable using it in order to become proficient in R programming.

## R Markdown
&lt;img src="img/rmarkdown.png" width="10%" /&gt;

- R Markdown is a tool to integrate code and written prose in reproducible computational documents

- R Markdown files have the `Rmd` extension. Each time you "knit," the analysis is run from the beginning.

- To learn more, go to [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

- Homework and take home exams will be completed in R Markdown

- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

---

## Tour: R Markdown

&lt;img src="img/tour-rmarkdown.png" width="90%" /&gt;

* Example: Create your first R markdown file and knit it.

---

In RStudio, you can start an R markdown document by clicking on **File, New File, the R Markdown**. 

You will then be asked to enter a title and author for your document. 

You can also decide what format you would like the final report to be in: HTML, PDF, or Microsoft Word. 

It will generate a template file.

As a convention, we use the **Rmd suffix** for these files.

In the template, you will see several things to note.

---

# The header

At the top you see:

```
---
title: "Untitled"
author: 'Jingwei Xiong'
date: "2023/1/10"
output: html_document
---
```

The things between the `---` is the header. We actually don't need a header, but it is often useful. You can define many other things in the header than what is included in the template. We don't discuss those here, but much information is available online. The one parameter that we will highlight is `output`. By changing this to, say, `pdf_document`, we can control the type of output that is produced when we compile. 

---

# R code chunks

In various places in the document, we see something like this:

````
```{r}
summary(pressure)
```
````

These are the code chunks. When you compile the document, the R code inside the chunk, in this case `summary(pressure)`, will be evaluated and the result included in that position in the final document. 

This applies to plots as well; the plot will be placed in that position. We can write something like this:




````
```{r}
plot(pressure)
```
````

---

By default, the code will show up as well. To avoid having the code show up, you can use an argument. To avoid this, you can use the argument `echo=FALSE`. For example:

````
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(pressure)
```
````

If you want to only show the code but not run the code, you can use the argument `eval=FALSE`.

````
```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(pressure)
```
````

By default, the code will run and the output will be shown.

---

# Knit your first rmd file

After you get the template rmd file, click this **knit**:

&lt;img src="1.png"
     width="70%" height="70%"&gt;

This button will process your source code into the final document, if your code has no error.

---

# Insert a new code chunk

To insert a new code chunk, click this:

&lt;img src="2.png"
     width="70%" height="70%"&gt;

This button will insert a new code chunk in the current cursor line.

---

# Run scripts in the code chunk

To run scripts in a code chunk, click this:

&lt;img src="4.png"
     width="70%" height="70%"&gt;

This button will copy all of the codes inside that code chunk into the console, and run it.

---

# Knit settings

You can find the knit settings here:

&lt;img src="3.png"
     width="50%" height="50%"&gt;

You can change to word using the output format.

---

# Try it yourself

1. Go to File -&gt; New file -&gt; R markdown to generate a new R markdown file. Change the title into "My project" and author as your name. Select the html document.

2. Save your rmd file into a place you know with a new name.

3. Knit the project as a html file. You should find the html file in the same location with the rmd file you saved.

4. Directly change the header in the rmd file into
````
title: "My first R markdown"
author: 'Jingwei Xiong'
date: "2023-03-22"
output: pdf_document
````

---


## Check list

* Install R and R studio on your own computer.

* Try it yourself, knit your first rmd file.
