## Statistics definition

> A statistic or *sample statistic* is any quantity computed from values in a sample which is considered for a statistical purpose.

* Recall: Population vs. sample 
  - A **sample** is a portion or **subset** of the larger **population**

  - **Population**: the entire group we would like to make conclusions about 

  - **Sample**: specific group we have collected data from 

  - Population **parameter**, e.g., population mean
    - This is a fixed quantity

  - Sample **statistic**, e.g., sample mean
    - depends on sample selected.
  
> Specifically, statistic is a **function** of a sample.

## Statistic inference background setting (formal definition)

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Overview]
* Population follows some **statistical model**: e.g: normal distribution.
   - This is called **population distribution**.
   - This is an assumption!

* Population parameter is the population distribution parameter. e.g: $\mu$ and $\sigma$ of normal distribution.

* Sample are random variables drawn from the population distribution

* Statistics are functions of a sample.
  - e.g: Sample mean, sample variance.
]
.panel[.panel-name[Population distribution]

> Any statistical inference requires some assumptions. The population is something we don't know and wants to infer,

* We need assumptions about population distribution: **population distribution**
  - We pick a statistic model, and assume the population follows that model (distribution)
  - The population distribution will have (population) parameters. *Assumed* **Unknown!**
  - We will cover those distribution details later.
| **Population** | **Model** | **Parameters**| **Math form**|
|:------:|:------:|
| Student heights | Normal distribution |$\mu, \sigma$ | $N(\mu, \sigma)$ |
| Heads in **fixed** $n$ coin toss | Binomial distribution |$p$ (Is $n$ a parameter?) | $Binomial(n, p)$ |
| Waiting time of a service center | Exponential distribution |$\theta$ | $exponential(\theta)$ |

* What happens if we use a wrong population distribution?

]
.panel[.panel-name[Sample, statistics]

* Samples are random variables (RVs) drawn from the population model.

* Sample size is how many samples you get from the population

* Statistics is a function of the sample.

## Statistical Inference

- **Statistical inference** allows us to draw conclusions about the larger population. It is the process of using sample data to make conclusions about the underlying population the sample came from.

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/soup.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
Similar to tasting a spoonful of soup while cooking to make an inference about the entire pot.
]

- This is one goal of statistics: to answer a question, by making **inferences** about a **population** based on data in one or more **samples**.

- The validity of our inferences depends on a variety of factors, including the **representativeness** of the sample

## Statistical inference

When a sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter, it will be accompanied by a margin of error

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/approval.png")
```

## Statistical inference

- In order to draw principled conclusions from our data, we rely on a formal probabilistic framework that allows us to **quantify uncertainty**.

- **Statistical inference** is built upon the foundation of **probability theory**.

- Many topics in statistical inference

  - Fundamentals: probability, distributions, random variables, ...
  
  - Sampling 
  
  - Hypothesis testing
  
  - Point estimates and confidence intervals
  
  - Modeling: Linear regression, analysis of variance, nonparametric models, machine learning, ...
