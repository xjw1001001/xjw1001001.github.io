# Instructions

+ Upload a PDF file, named with your UC Davis email ID and homework number (e.g., `xjw18_hw4.pdf`), to Gradescope (accessible through Canvas). You will give the commands to answer each question in its own code block, which will also produce output that will be automatically embedded in the output file. When asked, answer must be supported by written statements as well as any code used. 

+ All code used to produce your results must be shown in your PDF file (e.g., do not use `echo = FALSE` or `include = FALSE` as options anywhere). `Rmd` files do not need to be submitted, but may be requested by the TA and must be available when the assignment is submitted.

+ Students may choose to collaborate with each other on the homework, but must clearly indicate with whom they collaborated. Every student must upload their own submission.

+ Start to work on it as early as possible. Finishing this homework can help prepare midterm 1.

+ When you want to show your result as a vector that is too long, slice the first 10 objects. When you want to show your result as a data frame, use `head()` on it. Failure to do so may lead to point deduction.

+ Directly knit the Rmd file will give you an html file. Open that file in your browser and then you can print it into a PDF file.

# Instructions for book problems:

# Extra problems (Not grading, don't turn in)

1\. Consider a population in which 80\% of those who are college-educated are employed, and 60\% of those who are not college-educated are employed. In this population, 55\% of individuals are not college-educated. 

a. What is the probability of being employed? 

Let's use the law of total probability to find the probability of being employed. We have two groups here: college-educated and not college-educated individuals. Let's denote the probability of being employed for each group as follows:

P(E|C) = Probability of being employed given college-educated = 0.80
P(E|~C) = Probability of being employed given not college-educated = 0.60

Now let's denote the probability of being college-educated and not college-educated:

P(C) = Probability of being college-educated = 1 - 0.55 = 0.45
P(~C) = Probability of not being college-educated = 0.55

Now we can use the law of total probability to find the probability of being employed:

P(E) = P(E|C) * P(C) + P(E|~C) * P(~C)
P(E) = 0.80 * 0.45 + 0.60 * 0.55

P(E) = 0.36 + 0.33
P(E) = 0.69

So, the probability of being employed in this population is 69%.

b. If I pick five people at random from this population, what is the probability that none of those chosen is employed? (Hint: what random variable can we define? What distribution does this random variable follow?) Calculate the required probability by hand (you may use R as a calculator), then in R using a *single* function.

To calculate the probability that none of the five randomly chosen people is employed, we can model this problem using the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution models the number of successes (in this case, being employed) in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (in this case, picking people at random).

Let's define a random variable X, which represents the number of employed people among the five chosen. We know the probability of being employed (success) is 0.69 (P(E) = 0.69). We want to find the probability of having zero successes (employed people) in five trials.

The binomial probability formula is:

P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

where,

n is the number of trials (5 in this case)
k is the number of successes (0 in this case)
p is the probability of success (0.69 in this case)
C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time
So, we can plug in the values and calculate the probability:

P(X = 0) = C(5, 0) * (0.69)^0 * (1-0.69)^(5-0)
P(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.31)^5

P(X = 0) = 0.31^5
P(X = 0) ≈ 0.000286


2\. A student has trouble waking up for class. They have two different old alarm clocks. The first goes off 80% of the time, and the second goes off 50% of the time. Calculate the following probabilities:

a. Neither alarm clock goes off

b. One alarm clock goes off

c. Both alarm clocks go off

d. The first alarm clock goes off, given that the second goes off.


Let's denote the events as follows:

A1: First alarm clock goes off
A2: Second alarm clock goes off

We are given the probabilities:

P(A1) = 0.80
P(A2) = 0.50

We'll assume that the alarm clocks going off are independent events.

a. Neither alarm clock goes off:

To find the probability that neither alarm clock goes off, we need to find the probability that both don't go off. Since the alarm clocks are independent, we can multiply the probabilities that each alarm clock doesn't go off:

P(~A1) = 1 - P(A1) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20
P(~A2) = 1 - P(A2) = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50

P(~A1 and ~A2) = P(~A1) * P(~A2) = 0.20 * 0.50 = 0.10

So, the probability that neither alarm clock goes off is 0.10 or 10%.

b. One alarm clock goes off:

We can find the probability that one alarm clock goes off by calculating the probability of either alarm clock going off, minus the probability of both going off:

P(A1 or A2) = P(A1) + P(A2) - P(A1 and A2)

We'll find P(A1 and A2) in part c.

c. Both alarm clocks go off:

Since the alarm clocks are independent, we can multiply their probabilities of going off:

P(A1 and A2) = P(A1) * P(A2) = 0.80 * 0.50 = 0.40

So, the probability that both alarm clocks go off is 0.40 or 40%.

Now, let's go back to part b and calculate the probability that one alarm clock goes off:

P(A1 or A2) = P(A1) + P(A2) - P(A1 and A2) = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.90

So, the probability that one alarm clock goes off is 0.90 or 90%.

d. The first alarm clock goes off, given that the second goes off:

Since the alarm clocks are independent, the probability that the first alarm clock goes off is not affected by the second alarm clock going off. Therefore, the probability remains the same as P(A1):

P(A1|A2) = P(A1) = 0.80

So, the probability that the first alarm clock goes off, given that the second goes off, is 0.80 or 80%.

3\. The following table represents the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$:

| X \\ Y |  1  |  2  |
|:-----:|:---:|:---:|
|   1   | 0.2 | 0.1 |
|   2   | 0.0 | 0.2 |
|   3   | 0.3 | 0.2 |

a. Find the marginal distribution of X and the marginal distribution of Y.

b. Find the conditional distribution (conditional PMF) of $Y|X=1$ , $Y|X=2$ and $Y|X=3$.

c. Are $X$ and $Y$ independent? Why or why not?

a. Find the marginal distribution of X and the marginal distribution of Y.

To find the marginal distribution of X, we sum the probabilities in each row:

P(X=1) = P(X=1, Y=1) + P(X=1, Y=2) = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3
P(X=2) = P(X=2, Y=1) + P(X=2, Y=2) = 0.0 + 0.2 = 0.2
P(X=3) = P(X=3, Y=1) + P(X=3, Y=2) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5

To find the marginal distribution of Y, we sum the probabilities in each column:

P(Y=1) = P(X=1, Y=1) + P(X=2, Y=1) + P(X=3, Y=1) = 0.2 + 0.0 + 0.3 = 0.5
P(Y=2) = P(X=1, Y=2) + P(X=2, Y=2) + P(X=3, Y=2) = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.5

b. Find the conditional distribution (conditional PMF) of Y|X=1, Y|X=2, and Y|X=3.

To find the conditional distribution of Y given X, we divide the joint probability by the marginal probability of X:

P(Y|X=1) = P(Y, X=1) / P(X=1)
P(Y=1|X=1) = P(X=1, Y=1) / P(X=1) = 0.2 / 0.3 ≈ 0.667
P(Y=2|X=1) = P(X=1, Y=2) / P(X=1) = 0.1 / 0.3 ≈ 0.333

P(Y|X=2) = P(Y, X=2) / P(X=2)
P(Y=1|X=2) = P(X=2, Y=1) / P(X=2) = 0.0 / 0.2 = 0
P(Y=2|X=2) = P(X=2, Y=2) / P(X=2) = 0.2 / 0.2 = 1

P(Y|X=3) = P(Y, X=3) / P(X=3)
P(Y=1|X=3) = P(X=3, Y=1) / P(X=3) = 0.3 / 0.5 = 0.6
P(Y=2|X=3) = P(X=3, Y=2) / P(X=3) = 0.2 / 0.5 = 0.4

c. Are X and Y independent? Why or why not?

To determine if X and Y are independent, we need to check if the joint distribution of X and Y can be expressed as a product of the marginal distributions:

P(X, Y) = P(X) * P(Y) for all values of X and Y

Let's test this for all the joint probabilities:

P(X=1, Y=1) = P(X=1) * P(Y=1) = 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.15 ≠ 0.2

So they are not independent.


4\. On any given day, there is a 10% chance of rain. A person works in a casino with no windows. When it rains, customers wear rain boots 80% of the time. When it doesn’t rain, customers wear rain boots 5% of the time. If the casino worker sees a customer in rain boots, what is the chance of rain?

We are given the following probabilities:

P(Rain) = 0.10
P(No Rain) = 1 - P(Rain) = 0.90
P(Rain Boots | Rain) = 0.80
P(Rain Boots | No Rain) = 0.05

We want to find the probability P(Rain | Rain Boots). We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

P(Rain | Rain Boots) = P(Rain Boots | Rain) * P(Rain) / P(Rain Boots)

First, we need to find the probability of P(Rain Boots). We can use the law of total probability:

P(Rain Boots) = P(Rain Boots | Rain) * P(Rain) + P(Rain Boots | No Rain) * P(No Rain)
P(Rain Boots) = 0.80 * 0.10 + 0.05 * 0.90
P(Rain Boots) = 0.08 + 0.045
P(Rain Boots) = 0.125

Now, we can find P(Rain | Rain Boots):

P(Rain | Rain Boots) = P(Rain Boots | Rain) * P(Rain) / P(Rain Boots)
P(Rain | Rain Boots) = 0.80 * 0.10 / 0.125
P(Rain | Rain Boots) = 0.08 / 0.125
P(Rain | Rain Boots) ≈ 0.64

So, if the casino worker sees a customer in rain boots, the chance of rain is approximately 64%.

5\. People with the disease D have a 90% probability of testing positive on the D-test. If they do not have disease D, they have a 99% probability that they will test negative. We know that 5% of all people test positive.

a. What is the probability of having disease D?

b. A person just tested positive on the D-test. What is the probability that they are actually healthy?

a. What is the probability of having disease D?

Let's use the information given:

P(Positive | D) = 0.90 (90% chance of testing positive if they have disease D)
P(Negative | ~D) = 0.99 (99% chance of testing negative if they do not have disease D)
P(Positive) = 0.05 (5% of all people test positive)

We want to find P(D), the probability of having disease D. We can use the law of total probability:

P(Positive) = P(Positive | D) * P(D) + P(Positive | ~D) * P(~D)

We know P(Positive | ~D) can be found by subtracting P(Negative | ~D) from 1:

P(Positive | ~D) = 1 - P(Negative | ~D) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01

Now, we can rewrite the law of total probability using the complement rule:

P(D) + P(~D) = 1

We want to find P(D). Let's substitute the known values into the law of total probability equation:

0.05 = 0.90 * P(D) + 0.01 * (1 - P(D))

Now, we can solve for P(D):

0.05 = 0.90 * P(D) + 0.01 - 0.01 * P(D)
0.05 - 0.01 = (0.90 - 0.01) * P(D)
0.04 = 0.89 * P(D)

P(D) = 0.04 / 0.89
P(D) ≈ 0.04494

So, the probability of having disease D is approximately 4.494%.

b. A person just tested positive on the D-test. What is the probability that they are actually healthy?

We want to find P(~D | Positive), the probability of not having disease D given a positive test result. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(~D | Positive) = P(Positive | ~D) * P(~D) / P(Positive)

We have already found P(Positive | ~D) = 0.01, and we found P(D) ≈ 0.04494. We can now find P(~D):

P(~D) = 1 - P(D) ≈ 1 - 0.04494 ≈ 0.95506

Now, we can find P(~D | Positive):

P(~D | Positive) = P(Positive | ~D) * P(~D) / P(Positive)
P(~D | Positive) = 0.01 * 0.95506 / 0.05
P(~D | Positive) ≈ 0.19101

So, the probability that a person who just tested positive on the D-test is actually healthy is approximately 19.101%.

6\. A random experiment involves rolling a four-sided dice twice. Let X represent the sum of the numbers on the dice’s face.

a. Write the probability mass function of the random variable $X$.

b. Find $P(X=2)$

c. Find $P(X≤4)$.

d. Find $P(X=2|X≤4)$.

e. Find $E(X)$.

f. Find $Var(X)$.

g. If $Y = 2X+1$, what is $E(Y)$?, what is $Var(Y)$?


a. Write the probability mass function of the random variable X.

There are 16 possible outcomes in the sample space since we are rolling a four-sided dice twice. We can list all possible outcomes and their corresponding sum X:

(1,1) -> X = 2

(1,2) -> X = 3

(1,3) -> X = 4

(1,4) -> X = 5

(2,1) -> X = 3

(2,2) -> X = 4

(2,3) -> X = 5

(2,4) -> X = 6

(3,1) -> X = 4

(3,2) -> X = 5

(3,3) -> X = 6

(3,4) -> X = 7

(4,1) -> X = 5

(4,2) -> X = 6

(4,3) -> X = 7

(4,4) -> X = 8

The probability mass function (PMF) of the random variable X is:

P(X = 2) = 1/16

P(X = 3) = 2/16

P(X = 4) = 3/16

P(X = 5) = 4/16

P(X = 6) = 3/16

P(X = 7) = 2/16

P(X = 8) = 1/16

b. Find P(X = 2)

From the PMF, P(X = 2) = 1/16.

c. Find P(X ≤ 4)

To find P(X ≤ 4), we sum the probabilities of X = 2, X = 3, and X = 4:

P(X ≤ 4) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) = 1/16 + 2/16 + 3/16 = 6/16 = 3/8

d. Find P(X = 2 | X ≤ 4)

We can use the conditional probability formula:

P(X = 2 | X ≤ 4) = P(X = 2 and X ≤ 4) / P(X ≤ 4)

Since X = 2 is a subset of X ≤ 4, P(X = 2 and X ≤ 4) is equal to P(X = 2):

P(X = 2 | X ≤ 4) = P(X = 2) / P(X ≤ 4) = (1/16) / (3/8) = (1/16) * (8/3) = 1/6

e. Find E(X)

To find the expected value E(X), we multiply each value of X by its probability and sum the results:

E(X) = Σ[x \* P(X = x)] = 2\*(1/16) + 3\*(2/16) + 4\*(3/16) + 5\*(4/16) + 6\*(3/16) + 7\*(2/16) + 8\*(1/16) = 1/8 + 3/8 + 12/16 + 20/16 + 18/16 + 14/16 + 8/16 = 5

So, the expected value E(X) is 5.

f. Find Var(X)

To find the variance Var(X), we first find the expected value of X^2 and then use the formula:

Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2

E(X^2) = Σ[x^2 * P(X = x)] = 2^2*(1/16) + 3^2*(2/16) + 4^2*(3/16) + 5^2*(4/16) + 6^2*(3/16) + 7^2*(2/16) + 8^2*(1/16) = 4/16 + 18/16 + 48/16 + 100/16 + 108/16 + 98/16 + 64/16 = 440/16

Now, we can find the variance Var(X):

Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 = (440/16) - (5^2) = 440/16 - 25 = 440/16 - 400/16 = 40/16 = 2.5

So, the variance Var(X) is 2.5.

g. If Y = 2X + 1, what is E(Y)?, what is Var(Y)?

To find E(Y), we can use the linearity of expectation:

E(Y) = E(2X + 1) = 2E(X) + E(1) = 2 * 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11

So, the expected value E(Y) is 11.

To find Var(Y), we can use the property of variance:

Var(Y) = Var(2X + 1) = (2^2) * Var(X) = 4 * 2.5 = 10

So, the variance Var(Y) is 10.
